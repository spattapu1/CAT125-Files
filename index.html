Who is your partner’s intended audience? How do you know? (If your partner&#39;s audience does not at least include our class, how can you help your partner change their scope to</p><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">include their classmates?)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I believe that my partner’s intended audience is the class. Throughout her performance, she asks her audience to give feedback on the topics presented in the slides. Her audience is not only limited to those in the class, and can be expanded to those that are interested in the idea of scrapbooking or would like to learn more about it through her desire to push the creation of the individual&#39;s aesthetic. She notes how digital scrapbooking is not limited to those who already</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">have an appeal to their own aesthetic as it is through the collective participation of social media practices that promotes the social nature of the experience.</p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">What does your partner want to communicate to their intended audience? What details help you understand your partner’s intended argument?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I believe that my partner wants to communicate the idea that more people should be interested in the art of digital scrapbooking. Throughout her argument, she notes the fact that consumers of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the art are motivated by their own personal identity to strengthen their own beliefs and in general explore themselves to a greater degree. It is also noted that in this practice of scrapbooking it is important to be genuine and stay true to the things that you believe in and follow your own niche instead of appealing to the general public.</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">What outcome does your partner want as a result of their presentation? (Is there a call to action, explicit or implicit?)</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The ultimate goal that my partner wants to achieve is the promotion of digital scrapbooking as a way to express the individual and broaden the public scope of the art as it is the efforts of everyone, including creators, publishers, and viewers, that improves the art form as a whole.</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">Could your partner make the same argument using the same rhetorical strategies in a written essay, rather than in a presentation? In other words, how well does your partner’s presentation use its form and multimodal rhetoric? How do you know?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I believe that the argument made by the author could be in the form of a written essay, but the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">points in which she utilizes her own pinterest board to provoke the audience into giving feedback and become more engaged with her performance is a difficult task to accomplish on paper. By asking for feedback from the audience I believe she gains a greater attachment to the call to action she promotes and may result in a greater accomplishment of the result of her presentation had it been in an essay format which limits the rhetoric that is used throughout the performance.</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">Ideally, your partner should use at least some rhetorical strategies that are not possible to employ in the same way in a written document. If this isn’t yet true, what could they do to help their argument make better use of their presentation form?</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I believe that the rhetorical strategies used in the performance are greatly beneficial to the argument made, however, I think that providing greater scholarly sources may help to improve the argument in an educational manner. I feel as though this is the only thing lacking as her use of personal anecdotes and examples are very strong but to those who already are not familiar with pinterest just personal opinions alone may not be enough to convince them that aestheic appeal is important.</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">What details (or lack thereof) might distract, confuse, or fail to convince your partner’s intended audience?</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just in general repeating the last bullet point more scholarly and concrete evidence to support the author’s claim that curating one’s aesthetic is important would help to further convince my partner’s intended audience.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bonus: Does this piece remind you of any other presentation or video you’ve watched (whether for this class or outside of it)? How so?</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">While this piece does not really remind me of any other presentation or video I’ve watched, I am very familiar with pinterst and use it often to gain inspiration for outfits, room decor, and etc.. I am a firm believer of the author’s message as a result of my background which can influence the critiques given.</p></body></html>
